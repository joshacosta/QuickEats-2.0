Unfortunately, I believe I have some old configurations on my laptop that cause this issue. This is a poor solution but its a solution for now, sorry! I will be working this week to solve it so y'all will be able to simply run npm install and it work already. 

Reference the solution from this post on stack overflow, let me know if you need any help or questions.
